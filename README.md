# Overview

This project was created as part of the **Hello World Module** for the BYU-Pathway CSE 310 course.  
The purpose of this activity was to ensure a working development environment and demonstrate the ability to create, document, and publish software using GitHub.

The program was written in **TypeScript** and simply prints a personalized "Hello World" message to the console, along with some basic variable declarations and a simple function example.

A short video was recorded to demonstrate the program execution, provide a walkthrough of the code, and include a brief personal introduction.

# Development Environment

This project was developed using **Visual Studio Code** as the main code editor.  
The following tools were also used:
- **Node.js** (v22.11.0) – to run the TypeScript code after compilation.  
- **npm** – to manage project dependencies.  
- **TypeScript Compiler (tsc)** – to transpile TypeScript code into JavaScript.  

The code was written in **TypeScript**, a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other powerful features to make code more reliable and maintainable.
