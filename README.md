# Development Environment

This project was developed using **Visual Studio Code** as the main code editor.  
The following tools were also used:
- **Node.js** (v22.11.0) – to run the TypeScript code after compilation.  
- **npm** – to manage project dependencies.  
- **TypeScript Compiler (tsc)** – to transpile TypeScript code into JavaScript.  

The code was written in **TypeScript**, a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other powerful features to make code more reliable and maintainable.
